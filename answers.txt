1. Tell us a bit about the organism.
The organism I chose is the Parus major, better known by its common name, the Great Tit. This species is a small bird common to various locations, including Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia. It has a yellow underbelly and black head with white cheeks.
2. How many features does the file contain?
899444
3. How many sequence regions (chromosomes) does the file contain?
There are a total of 65082 features with a type of biological_region and 1675 with a type of region. According to the SOFA ontology, biological_region is a parent of chromosomes and region is a parent of biological_region. Therefore, there are a total of 66757 regions within the file.
4. How many genes are listed for this organism?
There are 15003 features with the type of gene
5. What are the top-ten most annotated feature types (column 3) across the genome?
386156	exon
356023	CDS
65082	biological_region
27488	mRNA
21684	five_prime_UTR
15003	gene
13504	three_prime_UTR
7258	lnc_RNA
4965	ncRNA_gene
1675	region
6. Having analyzed this GFF file, does it seem like a complete and well-annotated organism?
This appears to be a very complete and well-annotated organism. This reasoning primarily comes down to two major observations: (1) All of the feature types in the 3rd column are labelled, with know unknown types, and (2) Column 9, which contains annotated attributes, is very well defined in most of the features.
7. Share any other insights you might note.
While I do not have much insight to offer regarding the details of the genome, I had an interesting observation while learning more about the SOFA ontology and how it applies to this file. Since biological_region is a child of region, it is interesting to see them both used - and not a more descriptive identifier as well. I think this is likely due to the inability to further classify it with a more specific type, however, I hope to learn more about possible reasons throughout this course.
